Stop Google Tracking
=========

Stop Google Tracking is a Chrome Extension that removes outbound tracking code from Google.
This means that it will be more difficult to track outbound link performance.
Also, this speeds up browsing because one doesn't need to goto Google before going to the page they want too!

  - Install the .crx file to chrome to enable. Drag .crx file into chrome to install. Enable developer mode on extensions if that doesn't work.
  - Will parse Google.com to remove all known outbound tracking on search results.
  - This is meant to be used in combination with Ghostery and Ad Block plus
  - Obviously not available on Chrome store
  - Needs help to bind to ajax loads for search results. Currently just an interval of 1 second when landing on a Google domain. Hasn't really been tested.
  - Google can probably still track users via logs but not as well
  - Doesn't work with Shopping needs help

  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
