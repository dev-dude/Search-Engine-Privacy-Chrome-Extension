Search Engine Privacy Chrome Extension
=========

Stop Tracking is a Chrome Extension that removes outbound tracking code from Search Engines.
This means that it will be more difficult to track outbound link performance.
Also, this speeds up browsing because one doesn't need to go to the search engine before going to the page they want to!

  - Install the .crx file to chrome to enable. Drag .crx file into chrome to install. Enable developer mode on extensions if that doesn't work.
  - Will parse Search Engines to remove all known outbound tracking on search results.
  - This is meant to be used in combination with Ghostery and Ad Block plus
  - Needs help to bind to ajax loads for search results. Currently just an interval of 1 second when landing on a Search domain.
  - Changes User Agent. Needs better user agent spoofing

  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
