Stop Google Tracking
=========

Stop Google Tracking is a Chrome Extension

  - Install the .crx file to chrome to enable.
  - Will parse Google.com to remove all known outbound tracking.
  - Only works on search results.
  - This is meant to be used in combination with Ghostery and Ad Block plus
  - Obviously not available on Chrome store
  - Needs help to bind to ajax loads for search results. Currently just an interval of 1 second when landing on a Google domain. Hasn't really been tested.
  - Google can probably still track users via logs but not as well
